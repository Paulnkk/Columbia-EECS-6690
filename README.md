We build a malware detection system for Android based applications with Machine Learning techniques (Random forest, Extra tree, Ada boost, XG boost, Gradient boost) in Python. Additionally, we explored new techniques (Deep Learning and SVM) to tackle the challenge of finding the best models to predict malicious software. Please find attached our paper with test results, descriptions and explanations.
